'place' primitive: deposit the held object at a target location via MoveIt2.

Motion sequence:
  1. move_to_pose(pre_place)        — OMPL free-space approach above target
  2. move_to_pose_linear(place)     — PILZ LIN straight descent to release height
  3. open_gripper()                 — release object
  4. move_to_pose_linear(pre_place) — PILZ LIN straight retreat upward
  5. move_to_named("ready")         — PILZ PTP return to neutral

The place pose uses the same top-down orientation as the pick.
