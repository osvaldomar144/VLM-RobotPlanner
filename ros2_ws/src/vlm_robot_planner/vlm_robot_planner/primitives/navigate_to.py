'navigate_to' primitive: move the mobile base to a target location.

Phase 1 stub — the robot operates with a STATIONARY base in Phase 1.
Navigation via Nav2 is planned for Phase 3 (mobile base integration).

This stub logs the navigation request and returns True so the pipeline
does not fail on navigation steps during simulation. When Phase 3 begins,
replace the body of execute() with a Nav2 NavigateToPose action client call.
